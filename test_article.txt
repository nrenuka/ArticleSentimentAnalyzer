You've got to wonder whether Apple and AT&T are excited or worried about a repeat of last year's iPhone mania. Even though a few people have already started lining up outside Apple's Fifth Avenue store in New York, the buzz surrounding Friday's launch of the iPhone 3G has been far less prevalent on our shores this year than last year, when I thought I was going to lose my mind writing about Apple's first mobile phone. That makes some sense, since, in many ways, the iPhone is old news. But a new activation process could mean that Apple and AT&T will have to deal with a different kind of buzz: the grumbling of potential iPhone customers in long, slow-moving lines. The new model is expected to appeal to a wider audience than the first iPhone did because of the lower barrier to entry presented by the $199 price tag and the faster networking connection that will suck in those of us who couldn't imagine trying to surf the Web on an EDGE chip. Are new iPhone owners-to-be the types of people who enjoy being part of an Apple product launch, or would they rather just pick up the new phone on their lunch break and be done with it? iPhone 3G gives users ever faster access to the Internet and email over their cellular network with quad-band GSM and tri-band HSDPA for voice and data connectivity around the world. iPhone 3G supports Wi-Fi, 3G and EDGE networks and automatically switches between them to ensure the fastest possible download speeds. The new iPhone 3G also makes it easier to multi-task with simultaneous voice and data communications, so with iPhone 3G you can browse the web, get map directions, or check your email while you are on a call.
